          <span className="block mb-2">
            Picture a company implementing an online store integrated into SAP

            developing new features, multiple integrations, and working with
            various APIs.

          <span className="block mb-2">
            It also calls for working with multiple technologies and a specific

            <strong>User Adoption</strong>
            <br />
            With platforms like Salesforce you can monitor if the new technology
            is utilized effectively. You can track user engagement, frequency of
            usage or gather feedback to verify level of satisfaction (see
            below).

            <strong>Customer experience</strong>
            <br />
            Metrics worth noticing are NPS (Net Promoter Score) and CSAT
            (Customer Satisfaction). What you can determine is whether you have
            or haven&apos;t reached the goal of successful transformation from
            your user&apos;s perspective. Which is crucial.

            <strong>Project&apos;s efficiency</strong>
            <br />
            With tools like Tableau you can verify time spent on stages or
            tasks, costs, and more. The better streamline of processes, the
            better efficiency.

            <strong>Revenue Growth</strong>
            <br />
            At the end of the day, every transformation should bring more money.
            So is the digital one.

            <strong>Innovation</strong>
            <br />
            As we have stated many times, innovation is the backbone of
            future-oriented strategies. Only in this way can business leaders
            navigate through rapid market changes.

          <p className="pt-2">
            <strong>Employee engagement</strong>
            <br />
            Surveys and feedback mechanisms will allow product owners to check
            if employees stay engaged or become more productive. At the bottom,
            they are the ones who drive fundamental change.
